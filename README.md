SIMPLE CALCULATOR FOR EASY OPERATIONS
========================================================================
A normal vendors calculator with only 4 operations
The calculator can do the following:
	1. add using +
	2. multiply using both * and x
	3. devide using /
	4. minus using -
modifications that can be made: 
	other operators like quotient;
	modify to get other calculations like mean, average etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE: I will use 3 and 5
	to add : 3+5
 	to substract 3-5
	to multiply 3*5 or 3x5
	to devide 3/5
